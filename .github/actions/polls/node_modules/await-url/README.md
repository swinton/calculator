# await-url [![Build status for await-url on Circle CI.](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/sholladay/await-url/master.svg "Circle Build Status")](https://circleci.com/gh/sholladay/await-url "Await URL Builds")

> Wait for a given URL to continue.

## Why?

 - Alias a deployment when it is ready.
 - Run a health check on your service.
 - Know when it is safe to share.

## Install

```sh
npm install await-url --global
```

## Usage

```sh
$ await-url --help

  Usage
    $ await-url <url>

  Option
    --tries     Maximum number of polling attempts
    --interval  Milliseconds to wait between tries

  Example
    $ await-url example.com/status
    $ await-url example.com --tries=3 --interval=1000
```

Waiting until a URL returns 200 OK is especially useful to avoid sending traffic to it before it is ready.

Please consider whether a more efficient, event-based model is available to you before using this.

Default: `1200`
